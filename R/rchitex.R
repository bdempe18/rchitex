#' rchitex: Streamlining the transition from R to LaTeX
#'
#' The rchitex package is designed to facilitate the creation
#' of LaTeX articles from R models. rchitex provides
#' three main functions, \code{\link{build}} for regression
#' modls, \code{\link{describe}} for summary statistics,
#' and \code{\link{appendize}} and \code{\link{gg_tex}} for creating an entire LaTeX
#' appendix.
#'
#' rchitex's tex outputting allows for elegant console data investigation.
#' Data can be summarized and outputted with a wide range of customizations.
#'
#' Along with text output, rchitex supports latex and html output, making the
#' package optimal for use in Markdown files.
